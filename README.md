This project involved creating a rock, paper, scissors game where the computer generates a number between zero and one that will represent either rock, paper, or scissors. Then the user is prompted to enter rock,paper, or scissors
The values are compared and after five rounds a winner is declared. I used Claude to help me with the pseudocode for this project.
